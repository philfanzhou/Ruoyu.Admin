/// receipt starts as "not completed" and can only move forward, exactly once, when the
/// initializer returns. It never fabricates an installation record and never borrows the
/// ServiceMantle Bootstrap phase resolver. A successful initializer return is NOT proof of
/// schema completeness (the shared initializer swallows some ALTER failures), which is why
/// <see cref="AdminHealthSnapshotSource"/> still runs its read-only schema probe before
/// publishing readiness.
